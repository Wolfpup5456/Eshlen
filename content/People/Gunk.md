Gunk, a bugbear warrior played by Chaz

Gunk is described as an 8 foot tall bugbear with straightened and rather conditioned hair. He wears a brightly colored tunic with ruffles around the arms for extra flair. He does however have an outfit for every  occasion, sneaky or not, utilizing costume changes. His pants are also brightly colored though her doesn't wear shoes, showing his rather ugly bugbear tootsies. His hair is somewhat shorter around his face so that it doesn't cover it up. He has styled facial hair into that of a handlebar mustache. 

his backstory is s follows:
"Gunk doesn't know his real parents, but for as long as he can remember, this odd old goblin man named Plop took care of him. For many years, Plop would train Gunk to "fight like a man" as he put it. Around the time he was 22, an odd little Kenku kid came into his makeshift family. Plop taught the young lad to play a few different instruments, but most notably the banjo. He and Kenigan got along quite well, teaching each other their respective crafts. A few years later Plop would pass on, leaving behind a rather shittily drawn map to a location to scatter his ashes. "
