Glurp Slurmton, Plasmoid warlock played by Lucas

Glurp is described as a Greyish purple ball of goop. mostly rolls around as a fetid little glob, but reforms himself for comedic affect and spellcasting. 

his backstory is as follows:
"I was born in the Swamp of Oblivion (para elemental plane of ooze). Mostly raised by my loving lesbian hag aunts [[Sue Anne]] and [[Pussyclump]]. They watched me play in the mud, chase gnats, and even hung a cauldron in a tree so I could swing. [[Pussyclump]] (Aunt Pussy) let me smoke some of her incense, but we kept it a secret because [[Sue Anne|Sue]] didn't want it in the house. After their house sank in the mud while I was out, [[Ghaunadaur]] found me and claimed he was my dad. He raised me for about 3 years before sending me to the material plane with a fragment of his power."






"I drank some goo and talked to my dad." ~Lucas as Glurp Slurmton 2024
