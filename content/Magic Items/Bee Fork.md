ACTIONS

- **Sting**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +3 to hit, range 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. _Hit_: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm is at half its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 1 poison damage on a failed save.

ABOUT

A few bees here and there rarely pose much of a threat, but when a cloud of the insects form an angry swarm, it can spell trouble for any unsuspecting creatures nearby.
