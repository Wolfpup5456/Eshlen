On May 12th, 1024, *[[Plop]]* is killed by _[[Glurp Slurmton]]_. All that is left behind for his two adopted sons is a map seen below.

On May 15th, 1024 [[Gunk]], [[Glurp Slurmton]] and [[Kenigan Coo]] all embark on a journey to scatter [[Plop]]'s ashes

after a short stop at the town of [[Mudge Puddle]] for gear and supplies. after that, they embarked on the town of [[Grimsby]]. after some travel, [[Gunk]] is captured by bandits. the party is diverted to the [[Bandit Camp]] near the south coast. after a confrontation the party is left a scrap of paper, saying:

"Anybody you all find fit for work can be brought back to [[Grimsby]]"

the party set out for the town of [[Grimsby]]. On one of the dead bandits, [[Gunk]] had found a red bandana, which he tied around his arm as a fashion statement. the party made their way to the local tavern, [[Slurmton's Big Slurp|The Drunken Rat]] in search of information. [[Gunk]] brazenly entered the tavern and sat at the bar, as well as asked for a drink. The bartender knew exactly what that bandana meant and came over to _Gunk_ for a chat. He asked "Do you know what that bandana means?" [[Gunk]] responded with something along the lines of "Yeah I found it on some dead bandit in the forest. They had a whole camp out there and we all took it out." The bartender told _Gunk_ to wait there and went off into the back room, this caused [[Gunk]] to panic and run out of the Tavern and jump into a barrel across the street. _Kenigan_ followed. [[Glurp Slurmton|Glurp]] decided to squish his way under the door stealthily and spread himself across the floor in a corner. The bartender explained to the [[Bandit Leader]] that everyone in the [[bandit camp]] had been killed. at that moment, the [[Bandit Leader]] had noticed the suspicious pile of slime in the corner and decided to poke at it with a knife. [[Glurp Slurmton|Glurp]] decided that this would be a good to to make his escape and headed out of the Tavern. and across the street with the others. at that moment an absolute ton of bandits all wearing red bandanas came flooding out of every building and into the streets. [[Gunk]] decided that now would be a good time to remove that bandana.

This is where session 1 ended.
