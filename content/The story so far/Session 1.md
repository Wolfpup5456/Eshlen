On May 12th, 1024, Plop is killed by _Glurp Slurmton_. All that is left behind for his two adopted sons is a map seen below.

On May 15th, 1024, _Gunk, Glurp Slurmton, and Kenigan Coo_ all embark on a journey to scatter _Plop's_ ashes

after a short stop at the town of _Mudge Puddle_ for gear and supplies. after that, they embarked on the town of _Grimsby_. after some travel, _Gunk_ is captured by bandits. the party is diverted to the _bandit camp_ near the south coast. after a confrontation the party is left a scrap of paper, saying:

"Anybody you all find fit for work can be brought back to Grimsby"

the party set out for the town of _Grimsby_. On one of the dead bandits, _Gunk_ had found a red bandana, which he tied around his arm as a fashion statement. the party made their way to the local tavern, _The Drunken Rat_ in search of information. _Gunk_ brazenly entered the tavern and sat at the bar, as well as asked for a drink. The bartender knew exactly what that bandana meant and came over to _Gunk_ for a chat. He asked "Do you know what that bandana means?" _gunk_ responded with something along the lines of "Yeah I found it on some dead bandit in the forest. They had a whole camp out there and we all took it out." The bartender told _Gunk_ to wait there and went off into the back room, this caused _Gunk_ to panic and run out of the Tavern and jump into a barrel across the street. _Kenigan_ followed. _Glurp_ decided to squish his way under the door stealthily and spread himself across the floor in a corner. The bartender explained to the _Bandit Leader_ that everyone in the _bandit camp_ had been killed. at that moment, the _Bandit Leader_ had noticed the suspicious pile of slime in the corner and decided to poke at it with a knife. _Glurp_ decided that this would be a good to to make his escape and headed out of the Tavern. and across the street with the others. at that moment an absolute ton of bandits all wearing red bandanas came flooding out of every building and into the streets. _Gunk_ decided that now would be a good time to remove that bandana.

This is where session 1 ended.
