On May 15th, 1027, Session 2 picked up where Session 1 ended.

With the town full of bandits on full alert, the [[Party]] decides to sneak their way over to The [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]]. They are looking for any information they can about the map that [[Plop]] had left them. Successfully sneaking their way to the shop, they find [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]] cowered behind the counter. They all ask him what's going on in the town of [[Grimsby]]. He explains that the town has been overrun with bandits and that they have been keeping people in their homes, but beyond that, he doesn't really know. At that moment, a bandit comes in, and the [[Party]] dispatches him quickly and quietly. The [[Party]] then asks [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]] what they know about [[Plop]]'s map. He is unable to make heads or tails of the map; it's rather crude and unambiguous, but suggests that the rather large black line in the middle might be [[The Northern Hills]]. Two more bandits walk into [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]] and are quickly dispatched in a wonderful show of teamwork. Afterward, the [[Party]] decides that it's time to confront the leader of the bandits in the tavern. After easily sneaking over there, there is a big battle resulting in the death of the bandit leader. With the help of [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]], who came barreling in with no regard for his own safety, he holds down two bandits with just enough time for [[Gunk]] to take them out. [[Gunk]] also went down in this battle resulting in one failed death save but was able to be stabilized by [[Glurp Slurmton]]. [[Kenigan Coo]] also bends his beloved rapier severely once again, resulting in the weapon becoming less effective (a -1). After all is said and done, the [[Party]] thanks [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]] and asks him if he can hang onto the map that [[Plop]] had left them, to study it and see if he could figure out where it leads. The [[Party]] decides that they will commandeer [[Slurmton's Big Slurp|The Drunken Rat]] for their own and stay there for 3 days before the start of Session 3.

This is where Session 2 ends.
