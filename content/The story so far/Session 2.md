May 15th, 1027, Session 2 picked up where Session 1 ended 

With the town full of bandits on full alert, the party decides to sneak their way over to The *Cartographer*, they are looking for any information they can about the map that *Plop* had left them. successfully sneaking their way to the shop, they find the cartographer cowered behind the counter. they all ask him what's going on in the town of *Grimsby*. he explains that the town has been overrun with bandits and that they have been keeping people in their homes, but beyond that, he doesn't really know. at that moment a bandit comes in, and the party dispatched him quickly and quietly. The party then asks the *cartographer* what they know about *the Plops* map. he is unable to make heads or tales of the map, it's rather crude and unambiguous, but suggests that the rather large black line in the middle might be *The Northern Hills* or *Mount Big Hill* as the party likes to call it. two more bandits walk into the *Cartographers* and are quickly dispatched in a wonderful show of teamwork. after, the party decides that its time to confront the leader of the bandits in the tavern. after easily sneaking over there, there is a big battle resulting in the death of the bandit leader. with the help of the *Cartographer* who came barreling in with no regard for his own safety, he holds down two bandits with just enough time for *Gunk* to take them out. *Gunk* also went down in this battle resulting in one failed death save, but was able to be stabilized by *Glurp Slurmton*. After all is said and done the party thanks the *Cartographer* and asks him if he can hang onto the map that *Plop* had left them, to study it and see if he could figure out where it leads. the party decides that they will commandeer the *Drunken Rat* for their own, and stay there for 3 days before the start of Session 3

This is where Session 2 ends
