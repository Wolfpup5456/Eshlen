May 18th 1027, Session 3 picks up 2 days after Session 2

in the time between Session 2 and 3, the [[Party]] decided to staff and rename The Drunken Rat to [[Slurmton's Big Slurp]]. they decided that they were in need of a General Manager to fully staff and work out the finer details. [[Gunk]] put up job posters around the town detailing the need for a new GM.

Three people responded to the job offer:

- [[Eugene Muntz]]
- [[Torrence Zug]]
- [[Luce Perrella]]
- Tav urn

it was decided that [[Torrence Zug]] would become the taverns Bartender, [[Eugene Muntz ]]would become the Taverns GM and [[Luce Perrella]] would become the taverns cook. [[Gunk]] asked Luce if she had a child, she brings up [[Rolf Perrella]], her son. he becomes the taverns waiter, at 12 years old. the party were hesitant to give Eugene the job because they felt like he might sell off the business... somehow. after all the hiring was done a day or so later, [[Simeon Questell|The Cartographer]] came by the tavern to let the party know that their map was still very confusing to him, he still couldn't make out what it was trying to depict. he did let them know however that this map might be magical in nature, and that if the map is truly depicting [[The Northern Hills]], the dwarves that reside there would know something about it. he also informed them that the [[Baraborn Fynwaters|Mayor]] was looking for them. the party headed that way to find that they were rewarded 150 GP each, with another job attached. to clear out [[Penkith]], an old fort to the south east. they would be awarded an additional 150 GP for this job. The mayor also informed them that the [[Grimsby|Magic Bizarre]] was back up and running, and that the party should stop by and have a look. before then [[Kenigan Coo]] decided to head to the blacksmith and have his rapier repaired. after, they head to the bizarre to prose their wares. the shop keeper [[Niall Kupferschmidt|Magic Jerry]] has many to offer. the [[immoveable rod]] as well as the [[Harmony Shaper]] had caught the eye of [[Kenigan Coo]]. [[Glurp Slurmton|Glurp]] had bought the fancy moustache, [[rock|Jerry]], the shop keepers son who was turned into a [[rock]], as well as 4 [[expired potions]]. [[Gunk]] bought the [[Bee Fork]] as well as a [[magic 8 ball]]. after this they decide to head for [[Penkith]].

the party sneaks around the old fort for awhile, [[Kenigan Coo|Kenigan]] releases some captured towns people. [[Gunk]] has the bright idea to release and befriend a couple of caged dogs to help in an upcoming fight with the rest of the bandits from [[Grimsby]]. he is successful in doing so but catches the guards attention. [[Glurp Slurmton|Glurp]] has the idea to distract the guards using [[rock|Jerry]] giving [[Gunk]] enough time to rush over with his new found dog friends to kill the bandits. after all is said and done [[Gunk]] sends the dogs away leaving one bandit left who ran the nearby cave. The party continue in to find more capture towns people who are freed, as well as killing of the last remaining bandit. one of the prisoners among them is [[Tav urn]], the former owner of the [[Slurmton's Big Slurp|The Drunken Rat]]. the party explain to him that the tavern is now under their ownership, and after some convincing (Kenigan choking on [[rock|Jerry]] as a way of saying they will do this to him) Tav reluctantly releases ownership of his tavern.

later, in [[Grimsby]] the party decide to relive [[Eugene Muntz]] of his position as GM when they find 5 bottle of wine on the office floor, they decide because of his rather large size that he would make for a good bouncer. after some convincing, [[Tav urn]] is hired to become the new GM of the tavern, without pay, effectively making him the owner of a tavern he himself cannot own anymore. the [[Baraborn Fynwaters|Mayor]] returns to [[Slurmton's Big Slurp]] to pay the party their gold. rather selfishly [[Kenigan Coo]] talks up the price of their reward from 150 GP to 200 GP each. the mayor explains that a path should have been cut into [[The New Growth]] and that passage to [[Horrid]] is now possible.
